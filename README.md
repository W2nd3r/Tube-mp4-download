# Tube-mp4-download
What this does?

It downloads video in mp4 from the youtube url you gave.

What is required?

You have to have python, pytube and os installed

TESTED: This was tested on linux, so I don't know if it will work on windows or macOS

NOTE: You won't be able to download age restricted videos, because pytube doesn't allow to do so.
